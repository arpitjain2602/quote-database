# Quote Database for Chrome Extension

This repository hosts a collection of quotes categorized by topics such as **"Tech"**, **"Product Management"**, and **"AI"**, along with a **"Random"** category for general wisdom. This data powers a Chrome extension that provides daily inspiration.

## Data Structure

The quotes are stored in `quotes.json` as an array of JSON objects. Each object represents a single quote and follows this structure:

{
  "quote": "The actual quote text goes here.",
  "author": "Name of the author",
  "categories": ["Category One", "Category Two"]
}

- quote (string): The text of the quote.
- author (string): The person or entity attributed to the quote.
- categories (array of strings): A list of categories that the quote belongs to.

### Accepted Categories

- Tech
- Product Management
- AI
- Random

A quote can belong to multiple categories. Please use the exact category names.
